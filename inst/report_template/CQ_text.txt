##### Between 1 continuous and 1 categorical variables

Association between 1 continuous and 1 categorical variable can be measured using the t-test (for normally distributed data) or Mann-Whitney (for data with distribution other than normal). A p-value smaller than the significant level indicates that both the variables are predictable by each other. Unlike previous two cases, these test doesn't give a magnitude of association between 0-1, but only a p-value showing the significance.

```{r CQ}
amat <- pmat <- corr_all$continuous_categorical
amat[amat > 0] <- 0
corrplot(amat, p.mat = pmat, sig.level = 0.2)
```

The insignificant association (based on p-value) are crossed out at the desired level of significance (0.2).
