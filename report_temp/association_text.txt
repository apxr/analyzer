##### Between 2 continuous (numeric) variables

For this case, the **association** function internally utilizes the **cor** function. Since there are some variables which may not follow the normality assumption, we will keep the method as 'auto'. This will assign the method automatically to all the variables pair based on normality tests.

```{r CC}
corrplot(corr_all$continuous_corr, p.mat = corr_all$continuous_pvalue, sig.level = .2)
```
The above correlations are either Pearson or Spearman, decided by the function based on the normality tests. A value close to 0 means no linear correlation between the variables. As values increases towards +1, the linear positive correlation increases (one variable increases as other increases). Similarly, as value decreases towards -1, the linear negative correlation increases (as one variable increases, other decreases). The insignificant correlation (based on p-value) are crossed.

##### Between 2 categorical variables
Association can be measured between categorical variables using the chi-square test of independence on two-way contingency tables. A small p-value indicates that some association between the variables is present. Using the Chi-Square test statistic a measure of association can be calculated which is known as Cramer's V. This gives a value between 0 to 1. Like correlation we can measure the magnitude of association using Cramer's V.

The Cramer's V can be calculated using the Chi-Square test statistic using:

$$V = \sqrt{\frac{\chi ^2}{n*min(k-1,r-1))}}$$

Where:
**$\chi ^{2}$** is derived from Pearson's chi-squared test
**$n$** is the grand total of observations
**$k$** is the number of columns
**$r$** is the number of rows.

```{r QQ}
corrplot(corr_all$categorical_cramers, p.mat = corr_all$categorical_pvalue, sig.level = .2)
```

One thing to note is that Cramer's V doesn't give direction of association using negative and positive values like Pearson / Spearman correlation. But this only give magnitude of association.
