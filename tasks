0. Explain
  - add other group when number of classes are too high for frequency table
  - add factor levels in explain.factor

1. Associations
  a. Conitnuous - Pearson, Spearman, Kendall, for non-parametrics (if pearson is required for binary, binary can be set as numeric and method = "Pearson")
  b. Categorical - chi sq, Cramer's V, Kendall, Spearman for ordinal (passed as numeric type in order, with variable name in categorial argument)
  c. Continous - Categorical

  - Make option to do method selection at variable pair level

2. Plots
  a. Bubble plot for cross tables
  b. Data exploration -
    - Continuous
    - Categorical
    - Both vs y variable
  c. Association plots
  d. missing values plot

   - Make option to update the layout
   - only binwidth as parameter when binwidth.x and .y are NULL
   - option to select base color in place of #FF6666

3. Stuffs from NonParametric stats and Regression class

4. Norm_analyzer for normality checks including QQplots etc

modifications -
denisty plots - change Y with counts and remove y axis title
x numeric plots - update the limit of x axis so when changing the binwidht also keeps the axis same for both the above and below plot (binwidth = 5, for mpg of mtcars) - add x limit as [min-binwidth, max+binwidth]
