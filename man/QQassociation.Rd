\title{Association (Correlation) between Categorical Variables}
\usage{
QQassociation(factb, use = "everything")
}
\arguments{
\item{factb}{a data frame with all the categorical columns. This should
have atleast two columns}

\item{use}{an optional character string giving a method for computing
association in the presence of missing values. This must be (complete or an
abbreviation of) one of the strings "everything", "all.obs",
"complete.obs", "na.or.complete", or "pairwise.complete.obs". If use is
"everything", NAs will propagate conceptually, i.e., a resulting value will
be NA whenever one of its contributing observations is NA. If use is
"all.obs", then the presence of missing observations will produce an error.
If use is "complete.obs" then missing values are handled by casewise
deletion (and if there are no complete cases, that gives an error).
"na.or.complete" is the same unless there are no complete cases, that gives
NA}
}
\value{
a list of two tables with number of rows and column equal to number
of columns in \code{factb}:
\describe{
 \item{chisq}{Table containing p-values of chi-square test}
 \item{cramers}{Table containing Cramer's V}
}
}
\description{
\code{QQassociation} finds Association measure between all the variables in
data with only categorical columns.
}
\details{
This function measures the association between categorical variables using
Chi Square test. This also returns Cramers V value which is a measure of
association between two nominal variables, giving a value between 0 and +1
(inclusive). Higher number indicates higher association. Note that, unlike
Pearson correlation this doesn't give negative value.

The relation between Cramer's V and Chi Sq test is

\deqn{\sqrt{\frac{\chi ^2}{n*min(k-1,r-1))}}}

where:
\describe{
 \item{X}{is derived from Pearson's chi-squared test}
 \item{n}{is the grand total of observations}
 \item{k}{being the number of columns}
 \item{r}{being the number of rows}
}

The p-value for the significance of Cramer's V is the same one
that is calculated using the Pearson's chi-squared test.
