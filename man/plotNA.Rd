\title{Missing value visualization using ggplot2}
\usage{
plotNA(tb, order = T, limit = T, add_percent = T, row.level = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{tb}{a data.frame}

\item{order}{(logical) Whether to order the variables based on missing values
in plot}

\item{limit}{(logical) Whether to limit the plot to maximum missing value.
FALSE means the limit of axis will be [0, nrow(tb)]}

\item{add_percent}{(logical) Whther to add percent as data labels on bar plot}

\item{row.level}{(logical) Whether to create plot at rows and variables level}
}
\value{
This function returns a grob of class 'analyzePlot' which has a bar
  plot showing the count of missing value for each variable. \code{order,
  limit, add_percent} can be used to modify the bar plot. An additional plot
  will be created and added to the grob if \code{row.level} is set as
  \code{TRUE}
}
\description{
\code{plotNA} returns a grob visualizing the missing values in data
}
\details{
This is a function which helps in visualizing the missing values in data
using plots. By default a bar plot is generated which shows the count of
missing values in each variable.

If \code{order} is set as \code{TRUE} then the bars are arranged in order of
missing values. If \code{limit} is set as \code{TRUE} then limit of axis is
set to [0, nrow(tb)]. If \code{add_percent} is set as \code{TRUE} then
percent is added as text to the bars. If \code{row.level} is set to
\code{TRUE} then an additional plot is generated which shows which rows have
missing values and in which variable (reshape2
(\url{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/reshape2/index.html}) library
is required for this).

p <- plotNA(airquality)
# function to show the 'analyzerPlot' class plot

p1 <- plotNA(airquality, order = FALSE)
plot(p1)
